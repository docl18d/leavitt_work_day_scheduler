It is always nice to know what you will be doing for the day.  First thing in the morning is a good time to make a checklist and review the goals and taskings for the day.

This is a very easy to use and simple simple daily calendar application that allows the user to save events of the day by the hour. Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is the past, present, or future. When the save button for each timeblock is triggered, the text input for that event is saved in local storage. As a user with a busy schedule, I want the user to add important events to the daily planner, so they can manage their time more effectively.
